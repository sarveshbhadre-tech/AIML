<div class="example"><h2>Artificial Intelligence enables machines to think and act like humans.<br></h2>
         Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems of performing tasks that require human intelligence.<br>
          AI aids, in processing amounts of data identifying patterns and making decisions based on the collected information. <br>
          This can be achieved through techniques like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Robotics. <br>
          AI encompasses a range of abilities including learning, reasoning, perception, problem solving, data analysis and language comprehension.<br>
           The ultimate goal of AI is to create machines that can emulate capabilities and carry out diverse tasks, with enhanced efficiency and precision.<br>
         The field of AI holds potential to revolutionize aspects of our daily lives.<br>
In this article, we will know about What is Artificial Intelligence?, its evolution, various types of AI, training models, benefits.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
       Examples of AI:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, revolutionizing industries and impacting daily routines.<br>
 Here are some examples illustrating the diverse applications of AI:<br>
Virtual Personal Assistants: Popular examples like Siri, Google Assistant, <br>and Amazon Alexa utilize AI to understand and respond to user commands.<br>
 These assistants employ natural language processing (NLP) and <br>machine learning algorithms to improve their accuracy and provide more personalized responses over time.
Autonomous Vehicles: AI powers the development of self-driving cars, trucks, and drones.<br>
 Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber are at the forefront of this technology,<br>
  using AI algorithms to analyze sensory data from cameras, radar, and lidar to make real-time driving decisions.<br>
Healthcare Diagnosis and Treatment: AI algorithms are used to analyze medical data,<br>
 including patient records, imaging scans, and genetic information, to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases and planning treatments. <br>
 IBM's Watson for Health and Google's DeepMind are examples of AI platforms employed in healthcare.<br>
Recommendation Systems: Online platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify utilize AI to analyze user behaviour and preferences,<br>
 providing personalized recommendations for movies, products, and music.<br>
  These systems employ collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to enhance user experience and increase engagement.<br>
Fraud Detection: AI algorithms are employed by financial institutions to detect fraudulent activities in real-time. These systems analyze.<br>
AI is used in robotics, healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.

<div class="example"><h2>AI as Part of Artificial Engineering</h2>
<p>AI falls under the broader field of artificial engineering.<br>
     The field of artificial intelligence includes robotics, machine learning, and automation.<br>
      While AI is an advanced system, it operates based on data, algorithms, and user inputs.<br>
       It does not possess independent thought or creativity. Instead, AI processes information quickly and efficiently,<br>
        making it a valuable tool in many industries.<br>
Historically, every new technology has gone through phases of excitement and doubt.<br>
 The same is happening with AI. Some believe it is a revolutionary technology, while others see it as a tool that enhances existing processes.<br>
  The truth lies somewhere in between.<br>
Understanding AI as a Too<br>
Every industry relies on tools to improve efficiency. <br>
AI is no different. It assists in decision-making, data analysis, and automation. Robotics companies use AI for automation,<br>
 but these systems still require human guidance. AI cannot function without human input.
For example, businesses use AI for customer support, data processing, and content creation.<br>
 However, AI does not generate new ideas or strategies. Humans must provide context and creativity, <br>
 making AI a tool rather than an independent technology.</div>

<div class="example"><h2>Future of AI</h2>
The future of AI is likely to involve continued advancements in machine learning,<br>
 natural language processing, and computer vision,<br>
  which will enable AI systems to become increasingly capable and integrated into a wide range of applications and industries.<br>
  Some potential areas of growth for AI include healthcare, finance, transportation,<br>
   and customer service. Additionally, there may be increasing use of AI in more sensitive areas such as decision making in criminal justice, <br>
   hiring and education, which will raise ethical and societal implications that need to be addressed. <br>
   It is also expected that there will be more research and development in areas such as explainable AI,<br>
 trustworthy AI and AI safety to ensure that AI systems are transparent, reliable and safe to use.</div>
