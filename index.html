<div class="example"><h2>The Role of AI and Machine Learning in Modern Software Development</h2>
Creating computer systems that are naturally capable of carrying out activities requiring human intelligence is known as artificial intelligence (AI).<br>
 These programs mimic human decision-making, learning, and reasoning. Within artificial intelligence (AI),<br>
  machine learning (ML) is the study of algorithms and statistical models.<br>
   Without explicit programming, they allow computers to learn from data and gradually improve their performance.<br>
 The combination of AI and ML has changed software development, prompting advancement and innovation.<br>
    Artificial intelligence and machine learning have gained a lot of attention from software developers all over the years.<br>
    They are necessary due to their ability to reduce manual labor, optimize workflows, and increase overall efficacy. <br>
    AI and ML integration into software development processes is becoming essential as the need for intelligent applications grows.<br>
     In this article, we go over the crucial responsibilities these technologies play in influencing <br>
    the field of software development as well as the fascinating opportunities they present.</div>

<div class="example"><h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) </h2>
    It no longer restricted to being mere concepts and are finding application at societal levels to mitigate at least one layer of plaguing issues. <br>
    Both AI and ML are now being talked about increasingly and have even made it to academic circles as evident by their incorporation within university syllabi. <br>
Research in AI and ML have also been giving rise to numerous startups in India. With innovation and application of AI-driven <br>
solutions to societal sectors being the focal point, new-age technological disruption is inevitable.<br>
 Hence, problem solving becomes the focal point; through application of technology.</div>
